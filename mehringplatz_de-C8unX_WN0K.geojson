The  baroque monumental plaza at the end of the main North-South axis Friedrichstrasse, next to the Hallesches Tor (city door towards Halle), was completely destroyed during WWII.  Successively it found itself as a peripheral territory at the edge of Berlin Wall. Rebuilt in the seventies on a concept by Hans Scharoun readapted in residential key by its follower Werner Düttman, it has become a huge social-housing settlement inhabited mostly by immigrant households. The owner of most of the housing complex is today GeWoBag, a publicly owned private company. ",

As of January 2019, there are a total of 57 social conservation areas in Berlin. In the Südliche Freidrichsstadt it is established by a recent deliberation on the same area of the Sanierungsgebiet.\n\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis is Art. 172 Federal Building Code (BauGB). Extracts:\n• In a development plan or other statutes, the municipality may designate areas in which the demolition, alteration or change of use of building structures first requires official approval with the aim of maintaining the social composition of the resident population.\n• The state governments shall be authorised to determine, by statutory order with a maximum validity of five years, that the establishment of condominium ownership or partial ownership (Art. 1, German Condominium Act) of buildings intended to serve residential purposes may not take place in whole or in part without prior authorisation for plots in areas located within the scope of a statute in accordance with Sentence 1 (2).\n\n",
