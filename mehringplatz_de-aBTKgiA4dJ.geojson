The construction field development on the former flower wholesale market relies on participation. In the center of the site was placed the Bauhütte, a 60-square-meter project space, where the threads of the discussion about public participation, urban politics and architecture, youth and education converge. Here, residents, construction workers and architects, future users and builders meet at eye level to discuss on temporary use and trade development. So a small house makes a big contribution to the social cohesion of the people in the neighborhood. They get to know each other and can benefit from each other. For two years, it it has worked as a civil society platform in the middle of the construction site between Friedrichstrasse and the Jewish Museum. In summer 2019 the structure has been relocated to a new location next to the TAZ new building, surrounded by a new community garden. ",

Successively it found itself as a peripheral territory at the edge of Berlin Wall. Rebuilt in the seventies on a concept by Hans Scharoun readapted in residential key by its follower Werner Düttman, it has become a huge social-housing settlement inhabited mostly by immigrant households. The owner of most of the housing complex is today GeWoBag, a publicly owned private company. ",

As of January 2019, there are a total of 57 social conservation areas in Berlin. In the Südliche Freidrichsstadt it is established by a recent deliberation on the same area of the Sanierungsgebiet.\n\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis is Art. 172 Federal Building Code (BauGB). Extracts:\n• In a development plan or other statutes, the municipality may designate areas in which the demolition, alteration or change of use of building structures first requires official approval with the aim of maintaining the social composition of the resident population.\n• The state governments shall be authorised to determine, by statutory order with a maximum validity of five years, that the establishment of condominium ownership or partial ownership (Art. 1, German Condominium Act) of buildings intended to serve residential purposes may not take place in whole or in part without prior authorisation for plots in areas located within the scope of a statute in accordance with Sentence 1 (2).\n\n",

                "description": "\t\tDie Globale eV was founded in 2007 and focuses on early childhood education as well as social integration and community work. For years the association has been active at Mehringplatz and in Donaukiez. In the area of ​​educational work, the association operates two learning workshops in Kreuzberg and Neukölln as well as three day nurseries that work with the concept of discovery learning. The offer of the learning workshops is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 years. It aims to support the learning and learning motivation of adolescents and their interest in exploring their natural and social environment as an essential prerequisite for a successful educational process. The different offers take into account the different living conditions and lifestyles of the families in order to give the children a variety of access to educational processes. The work promotes the special interests and abilities of children and strengthens families as important educational partners for their children.\n\nThe second focus of our work is the development of neighborhood structures at Mehringplatz. As part of its offers, the club has established a good contact with the neighborhood. Through various activities (festivals, flea market, book rental), the association is known in the area and has already on numerous occasions supported residents to develop and implement offers for a neighborly gathering. From January 2015, the Neighborhood Commissioner will also be a permanent contact person for the residents of the neighborhood, with whom joint projects can be developed and implemented. The Neighborhood Café on Mehringplatz 7 also offers a public space where people from the neighborhood meet, articulate their needs and interests and use the place for encounters. The association is well connected with other social and cultural institutions and other organizations (Gewobag, Mieterbeirat, education network, tradesmen, AOK, Platzgärtner etc.) in the quarter. Through the daily presence in the square we know the existing problems, but also see the potential of the neighborhood, to whose development we would like to make our contribution.\n",

                "description": "In 2005 the area around Mehringplatz has been targeted by the national Soziale Stadt program (Socially Integrative City), identifying this territory as a deprived neighbourhood in need for specific social support measures according to standards defined at Federal level. Soziale Stadt is a complex and comprehensive community-led local development scheme that combines a tight spatial focus, local participation, and the integration of policies and human and financial resources. This federal programme, jointly financed by European Regional Development Funds and national funds, decentralises decision-making, by delegating responsibility for small-scale projects to residents living in deprived areas selected by the Berlin Senate. The program establishes a local Quartiermanagement that manages different types of Neighbourhood Funds, each covering a different type of project and working with the direct involvement of residents. The Quartiersmanagement teams provide a platform for networking and interaction, enabling groups and actors to debate and identify local needs, values and responses. ",
