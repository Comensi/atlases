Around 1730 - under King Frederick William I of Prussia - three new representative squares were built in front of three important city gates, which were initially named after their shape: \"Karree\" for Pariser Platz, \"Oktogon\" for Leipziger Platz and \"Rondell\" for Mehringplatz. This square, known as the \"Rondell\", was inspired by the city model of the Piazza del Popolo in Rome and was surrounded by two-storey town houses.

The construction field development on the former flower wholesale market relies on participation. In the center of the site was placed the Bauhütte, a 60-square-meter project space, where the threads of the discussion about public participation, urban politics and architecture, youth and education converge. Here, residents, construction workers and architects, future users and builders meet at eye level to discuss on temporary use and trade development. So a small house makes a big contribution to the social cohesion of the people in the neighborhood. They get to know each other and can benefit from each other. For two years, it it has worked as a civil society platform in the middle of the construction site between Friedrichstrasse and the Jewish Museum. In summer 2019 the structure has been relocated to a new location next to the TAZ new building, surrounded by a new community garden. ",

                "description": "Axel Springer AG is Germany's largest newspaper company and third-largest magazine publisher, known especially for its daily newspaper BILD.\nAfter the Second World War, Axel Springer founded a publishing house and in 1966 built the Axel Springer skyscraper, which served as its headquarters, right next to the Berlin Wall in Südliche Friedrichstadt (SF).\nThe SF area developed into a newspaper district as early as the end of the 19th century - during the industrialisation of printing. More than 500 businesses in the printing industry were based in the area between the Landwehr Canal in the south and Leipziger Strasse in the north, Wilhelmstrasse in the west and Lindenstrasse in the east. The three major Berlin publishing houses Scherl, Ullstein and Mosse also had their headquarters here (two of them in Kochstraße).\nThe significance of the media and its role in the dissemination of information made the neighbourhood an important site of tensions and conflicts, such as during the two World Wars, May '68 or the Cold War As of October 2016, the new Axel Springer building - designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas - officially opened on 6 October 2020.\nThe new Axel Springer building is located in the immediate vicinity of the existing publishing house buildings between Axel-Springer-, Schützen-, Zimmer- and Jerusalemer Straße. It is thus located in the heart of the former newspaper district and on the former course of the inner-German border, which runs right through the building.\nThe new modern architecture symbolizes the Axel Springer’s digital transformation.

Outstanding areas of the collection are Dada Berlin, New Objectivity, the Eastern European avant-garde and the art of the divided Berlin and the reunited metropolis.\nThe gallery was founded in 1975 as an association of committed citizens interested in art and has been a museum of the State of Berlin since 1994. Since 2004, the Berlinische Galerie has been housed in an old glass warehouse which was converted by the architect Jörg Fricke into a modern museum with around 4000 square metres of exhibition space, a large event hall, workshops, underground depots, office buildings and a café.

                "description": "The Dragonerareal is the largest property of Kreuzberg for new construction potential - but it is not a fallow area. From sculptors to nightclubs, various commercial and cultural institutions have existed there for decades. Last but not least, the Dragonerareal played a role during the November Revolution of 1918 in Berlin.\nIn the northern part of the town hall block, adjacent to Mehringdamm and Obentrautstraße, is the 4.7 hectare so-called \"Dragonerareal\". Traditional trade is based here - including a furniture upholstery, a marble factory, car workshops, artists, taxi school, the Club Gretchen and the LPG supermarket in an old gas station. The people working there are already filling the former barracks with life.\nIn August 2015, the Berlin Senate decided to prepare preparatory studies for the city hall block and the adjacent blocks to the north. The completion of these investigations in June 2016 resulted in urban development needs for the city hall block, which is part of the redevelopment area.\nThe area originally owned by the Federal Agency for Real Estate Tasks (BImA) was transferred to the state of Berlin by signing the capital financing agreement.\nThus, the state-owned BIM Berliner Immobilienmanagement GmbH takes over the administration and maintenance of the area.",

Conceivable formats include roundtable discussions, workshops, podcasts, and joint city exploration tours. More places of urban practice are to be found and new collaborations with the individual districts are to be initiated. The consolidation of already existing locations is to be supported.

The greengrocers Hermann and Paul Gutschow owned the imposing building in Wilheminian style in Friedrichstraße 17 on the opposite side of the street. Already in 1932, they placed their warehouse and basement at disposal of the ”SA-Sturmbann III/8\". These rooms were located here in the second courtyard of the building in Friedrichstraße 234. From March to May 1933, the place was one of the first concentration camps in Berlin. Prisoners called it ”Blutburg” (castle of blood). Hundreds of trade unionists, communists, social democrats and Jews were seized in their homes, at their places of work and in the middle of the street and were then abducted to this place. Interrogations, torture and humiliation followed - often for days on end. As these torture chambers of the SA were placed in a large tenement block, the neighbourhood knew about the imprisonment and maltreatment, for the screams of the prisoners could still be heard on the street.",

This project is taking place as part of the redesign of the redevelopment area. The aim of the planning is to coordinate the Besselpark, the playground, the Besselstraße and the open spaces at Charlottenstraße 98 to create an overall urban space.   \nThe wishes and suggestions of the residents were included in the landscape planning selection process in the course of a citizens' survey. The selection committee took the comments into account and the office of Rehwaldt Landschaftsarchitekten took on the responsibility of adding this to the project. In May 2017, the design was presented again in the redevelopment advisory board and offers for young people were discussed. This has been incorporated into the further planning.                                                            ",

                "description": "In 2005 the area around Mehringplatz has been targeted by the national Soziale Stadt program (Socially Integrative City), identifying this territory as a deprived neighbourhood in need for specific social support measures according to standards defined at Federal level. Soziale Stadt is a complex and comprehensive community-led local development scheme that combines a tight spatial focus, local participation, and the integration of policies and human and financial resources. This federal programme, jointly financed by European Regional Development Funds and national funds, decentralises decision-making, by delegating responsibility for small-scale projects to residents living in deprived areas selected by the Berlin Senate. The program establishes a local Quartiermanagement that manages different types of Neighbourhood Funds, each covering a different type of project and working with the direct involvement of residents. The Quartiersmanagement teams provide a platform for networking and interaction, enabling groups and actors to debate and identify local needs, values and responses. ",

Also, Kiezstube encourages community involvement in their district.\nInitially, the Kiezstube was managed by Die Globale e.V., which was taken over by Gewobag after the renovation of the premises in 2017. Gewobag currently operates ten neighbourhood rooms in various quarters of Berlin.\nIn 2018 after a closing due to several months of urgent renovation the Kiezstube was reopened for everyone who wants to make a difference in the neighborhood.",

                "description": "  Die Globale eV was founded in 2007 and focuses on early childhood education as well as social integration and community work. For years the association has been active at Mehringplatz and in Donaukiez. In the area of ​​educational work, the association operates two learning workshops in Kreuzberg and Neukölln as well as three day nurseries that work with the concept of discovery learning. The offer of the learning workshops is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 years. It aims to support the learning and learning motivation of adolescents and their interest in exploring their natural and social environment as an essential prerequisite for a successful educational process. The different offers take into account the different living conditions and lifestyles of the families in order to give the children a variety of access to educational processes. The work promotes the special interests and abilities of children and strengthens families as important educational partners for their children.\nThe second focus of our work is the development of neighborhood structures at Mehringplatz. As part of its offers, the club has established a good contact with the neighborhood. Through various activities (festivals, flea market, book rental), the association is known in the area and has already on numerous occasions supported residents to develop and implement offers for a neighborly gathering. From January 2015, the Neighborhood Commissioner will also be a permanent contact person for the residents of the neighborhood, with whom joint projects can be developed and implemented. The Neighborhood Café on Mehringplatz 7 also offers a public space where people from the neighborhood meet, articulate their needs and interests and use the place for encounters. The association is well connected with other social and cultural institutions and other organizations (Gewobag, Mieterbeirat, education network, tradesmen, AOK, Platzgärtner etc.) in the quarter. Through the daily presence in the square we know the existing problems, but also see the potential of the neighborhood, to whose development we would like to make our contribution.\n",

It collects and makes accessible data, memories and visions about the neighbourhood. It  combines qualitative and quantitative data, personal narratives and public documents to provide a complex and nuanced representation of the local identity. The neighbourhood atlas maps local initiatives, actors, plans and policies, with a focus on processes of civic engagement, co-creation and social inclusion. Its elaboration started in 2016 through the EU funded Erasmus+ project EULER, as the outcome of a series of laboratories dedicated to urban reconnaissance, collaborative mapping and digital storytelling. It is currently implemented through the COMENSI project testing the digital atlas prototype to publish contents co-created with local communities.",
