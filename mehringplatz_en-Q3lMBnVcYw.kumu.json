The people working there are already filling the former barracks with life.\nIn August 2015, the Berlin Senate decided to prepare preparatory studies for the city hall block and the adjacent blocks to the north.

More than 500 businesses in the printing industry were based in the area between the Landwehr Canal in the south and Leipziger Strasse in the north, Wilhelmstrasse in the west and Lindenstrasse in the east. The three major Berlin publishing houses Scherl, Ullstein and Mosse also had their headquarters here (two of them in Kochstraße).\nThe significance of the media and its role in the dissemination of information made the neighbourhood an important site of tensions and conflicts, such as during the two World Wars, May '68 or the Cold War As of October 2016, the new Axel Springer building - designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas - officially opened on 6 October 2020.\nThe new Axel Springer building is located in the immediate vicinity of the existing publishing house buildings between Axel-Springer-, Schützen-, Zimmer- and Jerusalemer Straße. It is thus located in the heart of the former newspaper district and on the former course of the inner-German border, which runs right through the building.\nThe new modern architecture symbolizes the Axel Springer’s digital transformation.

For years the association has been active at Mehringplatz and in Donaukiez. In the area of ​​educational work, the association operates two learning workshops in Kreuzberg and Neukölln as well as three day nurseries that work with the concept of discovery learning. The offer of the learning workshops is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 years. It aims to support the learning and learning motivation of adolescents and their interest in exploring their natural and social environment as an essential prerequisite for a successful educational process. The different offers take into account the different living conditions and lifestyles of the families in order to give the children a variety of access to educational processes. The work promotes the special interests and abilities of children and strengthens families as important educational partners for their children.\nThe second focus of our work is the development of neighborhood structures at Mehringplatz. As part of its offers, the club has established a good contact with the neighborhood. Through various activities (festivals, flea market, book rental), the association is known in the area and has already on numerous occasions supported residents to develop and implement offers for a neighborly gathering. From January 2015, the Neighborhood Commissioner will also be a permanent contact person for the residents of the neighborhood, with whom joint projects can be developed and implemented. The Neighborhood Café on Mehringplatz 7 also offers a public space where people from the neighborhood meet, articulate their needs and interests and use the place for encounters. The association is well connected with other social and cultural institutions and other organizations (Gewobag, Mieterbeirat, education network, tradesmen, AOK, Platzgärtner etc.) in the quarter. Through the daily presence in the square we know the existing problems, but also see the potential of the neighborhood, to whose development we would like to make our contribution.\n","image":"http://dieglobale.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/globale_logo-web_header.png","category":"Stakeholders","sub-category":"NGO/Social work","tags":[],"category-description":"Formal and informal actors in the area","links":[{"url":"http://dieglobale.org/","title":"","description":"","type":"website"}],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/caf_madame#26"],"created_date":"2019-09-27T10:10:08.037+01:00","updated_date":"2022-06-29T08:36:44.166+01:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/die_globale_e_v_#27"},{"title":"ZLB - Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek","type":"Organization","start_date":"","end_date":"","description":"One of the two seats of the Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin (ZLB).

This federal programme, jointly financed by European Regional Development Funds and national funds, decentralises decision-making, by delegating responsibility for small-scale projects to residents living in deprived areas selected by the Berlin Senate. The program establishes a local Quartiermanagement that manages different types of Neighbourhood Funds, each covering a different type of project and working with the direct involvement of residents. The Quartiersmanagement teams provide a platform for networking and interaction, enabling groups and actors to debate and identify local needs, values and responses.

The city was enlarged and new city gates were built. One of these gates was the Halle Gate. Around 1730 - under King Frederick William I of Prussia - three new representative squares were built in front of three important city gates, which were initially named after their shape: \"Karree\" for Pariser Platz, \"Oktogon\" for Leipziger Platz and \"Rondell\" for Mehringplatz. This square, known as the \"Rondell\", was inspired by the city model of the Piazza del Popolo in Rome and was surrounded by two-storey town houses.

A temporary structure built to facilitate the social integration of the new development projects of the Baufeld program. The construction field development on the former flower wholesale market relies on participation. In the center of the site was placed the Bauhütte, a 60-square-meter project space, where the threads of the discussion about public participation, urban politics and architecture, youth and education converge. Here, residents, construction workers and architects, future users and builders meet at eye level to discuss on temporary use and trade development. So a small house makes a big contribution to the social cohesion of the people in the neighborhood. They get to know each other and can benefit from each other. For two years, it it has worked as a civil society platform in the middle of the construction site between Friedrichstraße and the Jewish Museum. In summer 2019 the structure has been relocated to a new location next to the TAZ new building, surrounded by a new community garden.

Therefore, the spatial conditions for users and staff are currently not ideal. In June 2018, after an intensive examination of different locations, the Berlin Senate decided to build the ZLB at Blücherplatz. In addition to the existing Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek (AGB), the new ZLB will require further building sections and will change the urban development of Blücherplatz. To this end, the complex traffic situation in the surrounding area, including Blücherstraße, is also being investigated. In autumn 2019 to spring 2020, a dialogue process \"urban planning feasibility study ZLB am Blücherplatz\" was conducted. Here, urban planners, architects, landscape planners, traffic planners, librarians and citizens discussed with each other how the new building can fit in well on the site at the AGB. Special attention was paid to how to deal with the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek monument, the green space at Blücherplatz and the complex traffic situation, as well as Blücherstraße. The findings form the basis for the further planning of the new building and the outdoor facilities.\nOnce the examination of the programme of requirements has been completed, the general conditions, requirements and also an initial cost framework for the new ZLB building project will be established. On this basis, the preparations for the architectural competition will begin. A project will then be selected so that construction can begin in 2026.","image":"https://i.ibb.co/6v5WFZ6/Interaktive-Wand-2.jpg","category":"Transformations","sub-category":"","tags":["social inclusion","Public space"],"category-description":"Current projects, conflicts and initiatives - transformations taking place in the area","links":[{"url":"https://www.zlb.de/ueber-uns/projekte/neubauprojekt/aktuelles.html?d=0","title":"","description":"","type":"website"}],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/zlb_amerika_gedenkbibliothek#30"],"created_date":"2023-07-19T12:40:12.197+01:00","updated_date":"2023-07-21T14:11:04.412+01:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"ZLB","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/new_building_of_the_zlb_at_bl_cherplatz#67"},{"title":"Hedwig Dohm Gedenktafel","type":"Monument","start_date":"","end_date":"","description":"Marianne Adelaide Hedwig Dohm  (20 September 1831 – 1 June 1919) was a German feminist, and author.
