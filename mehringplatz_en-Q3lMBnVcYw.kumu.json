The greengrocers Hermann and Paul Gutschow owned the imposing building in Wilheminian style in Friedrichstraße 17 on the opposite side of the street. Already in 1932, they placed their warehouse and basement at disposal of the ”SA-Sturmbann III/8\". These rooms were located here in the second courtyard of the building in Friedrichstraße 234. From March to May 1933, the place was one of the first concentration camps in Berlin. Prisoners called it ”Blutburg” (castle of blood). Hundreds of trade unionists, communists, social democrats and Jews were seized in their homes, at their places of work and in the middle of the street and were then abducted to this place. Interrogations, torture and humiliation followed - often for days on end. As these torture chambers of the SA were placed in a large tenement block, the neighbourhood knew about the imprisonment and maltreatment, for the screams of the prisoners could still be heard on the street.","image":"https://i.ibb.co/S0gGzzJ/Kozentrationslager-Gutschow-Keller.jpg","category":"Memories","sub-category":"Plaques/Information displays","tags":["history","WWII"],"category-description":"Document of material and immaterial heritage","links":[{"url":"https://www.gedenktafeln-in-berlin.de/nc/gedenktafeln/gedenktafel-anzeige/tid/konzentrationslager/","title":"Plaque","description":"","type":"website"}],"relationships":[],"created_date":"2020-03-25T10:43:39.974-07:00","updated_date":"2020-03-25T10:59:42.696-07:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/gutschow_keller_concentration_camp#55"},{"title":"Friedrichstadt ","type":"Place","start_date":"","description":"Friedrichstadt is a historical neighbourhood of Berlin located south of the twin-city zone of Berlin and Cölln.

For years the association has been active at Mehringplatz and in Donaukiez. In the area of ​​educational work, the association operates two learning workshops in Kreuzberg and Neukölln as well as three day nurseries that work with the concept of discovery learning. The offer of the learning workshops is aimed at children between the ages of four and 12 years. It aims to support the learning and learning motivation of adolescents and their interest in exploring their natural and social environment as an essential prerequisite for a successful educational process. The different offers take into account the different living conditions and lifestyles of the families in order to give the children a variety of access to educational processes. The work promotes the special interests and abilities of children and strengthens families as important educational partners for their children.\n\nThe second focus of our work is the development of neighborhood structures at Mehringplatz. As part of its offers, the club has established a good contact with the neighborhood. Through various activities (festivals, flea market, book rental), the association is known in the area and has already on numerous occasions supported residents to develop and implement offers for a neighborly gathering. From January 2015, the Neighborhood Commissioner will also be a permanent contact person for the residents of the neighborhood, with whom joint projects can be developed and implemented. The Neighborhood Café on Mehringplatz 7 also offers a public space where people from the neighborhood meet, articulate their needs and interests and use the place for encounters. The association is well connected with other social and cultural institutions and other organizations (Gewobag, Mieterbeirat, education network, tradesmen, AOK, Platzgärtner etc.) in the quarter. Through the daily presence in the square we know the existing problems, but also see the potential of the neighborhood, to whose development we would like to make our contribution.\n","image":"http://dieglobale.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/globale_logo-web_header.png","category":"Stakeholders","sub-category":"NGO/Social work","tags":[],"category-description":"Formal and informal actors in the area","links":[{"url":"http://dieglobale.org/","title":"","description":"","type":"website"}],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/caf_madame#26"],"created_date":"2019-09-27T02:10:08.037-07:00","updated_date":"2019-11-25T04:59:00.005-08:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/die_globale_e_v_#27"},{"title":"Café MaDaMe","type":"Place","start_date":"","description":"Café that acts as a essential community hub in the neghibourhood.","image":"http://dieglobale.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tresen-Cafe.jpg","category":"Places","sub-category":"Community hub","tags":["cooking","culture","social inclusion"],"category-description":"Locations that are recognised by the community or important reference points","links":[],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/die_globale_e_v_#27"],"created_date":"2019-09-27T01:50:32.870-07:00","updated_date":"2019-11-25T04:59:00.005-08:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/caf_madame#26"},{"title":"Kiezstube Mehringpltz","type":"Place","start_date":"","description":"","image":"http://qm-mehringplatz.info/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_2018_eroeffn_kiezstube06_b9c3ae922e.jpg","category":"Places","sub-category":"Community hub","tags":["social inclusion","quartiersmanagement"],"category-description":"Locations that are recognised by the community or important reference points","links":[],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/mehringplatz#39","mehringplatz-community-atlas/gewobag#23","mehringplatz-community-atlas/sanierungsbeirates_s_dliche_friedrichstadt_friedrichstadt_s_d_#21"],"created_date":"2019-09-27T01:27:56.456-07:00","updated_date":"2019-11-27T02:19:55.455-08:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/kiezstube_mehringpltz#25"},{"title":"Vielfalt E.V.","type":"Organization","start_date":"","description":"\nSozialpädagogische Familienverein und Träger der öffentlichen Jugendhilfe/ Social-Educational Family Association for public youth welfare\n\n\"Strave to a society fully supportive of the development of its younger participants -Support for children, teenagers and young people of all cultures with open dialogue and confrontation.Protect/strengthen/implementation of childrens and teenagers rights.\n- Support of families with migration background (if necessary also in their language of origin) and promotion of coexistence in diversity. - Focus on help and advice on educational questions; assistance including: family therapy, social group work, child support, childcare assistance, family welfare counseling and intensive individual social care. \"","image":"https://i.ibb.co/C8f07pg/Screenshot-2019-09-27-at-10-12-00.png","category":"Stakeholders","sub-category":"NGO/Social work","tags":[],"category-description":"Formal and informal actors in the area","links":[{"url":"http://www.vielfaltev.de/","title":"","description":"","type":"website"}],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/die_globale_e_v_#27"],"created_date":"2019-09-27T01:02:35.669-07:00","updated_date":"2019-11-25T04:59:00.005-08:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/vielfalt_e_v_#24"},{"title":"Sanierungsgebiet Südliche Friedrichstadt","type":"Program","start_date":"2011-04-01T06:00:00.000-07:00","description":"","image":"http://www.sanierung-suedliche-friedrichstadt.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SFS-Luftild-Geltungsbereich-753x1024.jpg","category":"Delimitations","sub-category":"Public space","tags":["Public space","Urban regeneration"],"category-description":"An area of interest or defining administrative borders or policies","links":[{"url":"http://www.sanierung-suedliche-friedrichstadt.de/","title":"Official website","description":"","type":"website"},{"url":"http://www.sanierung-suedliche-friedrichstadt.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SFS-Luftild-Geltungsbereich-753x1024.jpg","title":"Area","description":"","type":"image"}],"relationships":["mehringplatz-community-atlas/sanierungsbeirates_s_dliche_friedrichstadt_friedrichstadt_s_d_#21","","mehringplatz-community-atlas/besselpark_regeneration_#11"],"created_date":"2019-09-26T06:31:05.747-07:00","updated_date":"2019-11-25T04:59:00.005-08:00","weight":0,"image_credit":"","id":"mehringplatz-community-atlas/sanierungsgebiet_s_dliche_friedrichstadt#22"},{"title":"Donut Wedge with Two Balls ","type":"Monument","start_date":"","description":"Large sculpture  donated in 2010 to the city of Berlin by the San Francisco based artist Fletcher Benton .
