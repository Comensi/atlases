Referred to in the media as “Milieuschutzgebiete“ (social environment protection areas), these are legally established areas for preserving the composition of the resident population. In the Südliche Freidrichsstadt it is established by a recent deliberation on the same area of the Sanierungsgebiet.\nLegal basis\nThe legal basis is Art. 172 Federal Building Code (BauGB). Extracts:\n• In a development plan or other statutes, the municipality may designate areas in which the demolition, alteration or change of use of building structures first requires official approval with the aim of maintaining the social composition of the resident population.\n• The state governments shall be authorised to determine, by statutory order with a maximum validity of five years, that the establishment of condominium ownership or partial ownership (Art. 1, German Condominium Act) of buildings intended to serve residential purposes may not take place in whole or in part without prior authorisation for plots in areas located within the scope of a statute in accordance with Sentence 1 (2).\n\n",
