Abandoned in the course of the XXst century, it was converted into a community centre, named the Mayville Community Centre back then, by residents of the Mayville Estate in the 1970s. In 2004, Mildmay Community Partnership took over the responsibility and management of the centre. Closed for a few years for renovation, the centre re-opened in 2011, as the first Passive House (an energy-efficient building) of the UK.
