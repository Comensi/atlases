Die Begine is found at Potsdamer Straße 139 and is the last major autonomous women's project that was able to develop without being threatened by the rent increases in the past 25 years. This autonomous Berlin women’s cultural centre serves as an alternative venue for lesbian and feminist women. \n\nThis cultural centre is a space exclusively for women. Begine was established in 1986 in a squatted building that the women living there had refurbished, to provide a place for meeting others and for self-help. Ever since then, it has been both a meeting point and a cultural centre.",
